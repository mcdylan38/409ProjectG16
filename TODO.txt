Code TODO:
* commandline SQL credentials input
* will need new data ovjects to support dynamic SQL access
* error handling on order input from terminal
* try/catch with IO, generating order.
* Database connectivity test and subsequent error handling
* probably just a good idea to apply error handing to anything that is suseptible to non-code related errors
UML TODO:
* figure out how to underline parts of text lmao
* update variables as the code changes
* draw relations

Unit-Testing TODO:
