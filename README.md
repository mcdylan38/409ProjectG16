Repository for W2021 Team Project Work &amp; Deliverables

Final project for ENSF 409 in Winter 2021

Project required students to access a database that contained parts of furniture and see if the pieces could make a desired number of furniture. If so, an order form was
printed holding the IDs of the pieces used to create the furniture, the total price and the manufacturer. If the furniture cannot be made using the available pieces, an error
message was printed to the console instead.

The project made use of MySQL databases, that is included in the repository.
